       " 'selftext': 'I just need to get this off my chest.  \\n  \\nEver since the start of this school year I haven\\'t been truly happy. I\\'m in my second year of this early college program and I always feel stressed out. The workload is overwhelming, especially for my English class, which is actually just an AP class. I hate the teacher; her personality is annoying, we have a paper due pretty much every week, a lot of nights we have to complete these stupid journals about some literary technique that she\\'s already told us about 1000 times. I\\'m not failing the class or anything, but she has made me hate English. The two college classes I take are fine, challenging but pretty bearable. It\\'s just that even on the weekends when the other kids at my highschool get a break, I\\'m stuck finishing a paper or assignment. I feel like I\\'m going to be working my entire life and never have any time for the things I want to do. I\\'m fatigued, and I lack motivation to keep going. I love sports, and have always wanted to play on a team in highschool, but there\\'s no way I\\'d be able to manage the work and having to go to practice. Other kids in the program play some sort of sport, but I have no idea how they do it. The only reason I stay in the program is so my parents don\\'t have to pay as much for college. I usually only get 6-7 hours of sleep each night. This is supposed to be the worst year of the program (sophomore year), and so far it\\'s killing me. I used to care about being top of my class, but it means nothing to me anymore.  \\n  \\nAnother thing is that I really don\\'t have any best friends. I have good friends from the program and at my highschool, but they all have better friends and a group that they fit into. I could never fit into their groups because I just don\\'t like the rest of their friends and we don\\'t have the same sense of humor or same interests. Last Friday we had a pep rally for homecoming and I just sat by myself. It hurts. To be honest, I can\\'t find anyone who has enough of the same interests as me that we could become best friends. I barely text or snap anyone, and barely anyone texts or snaps me. I can\\'t remember the last time I went out with friends to do something, which is partly because of the school work. I know I have to put myself out there, but it\\'s just so hard. I\\'m so lonely, I feel like I don\\'t belong.  \\n  \\nI know I shouldn\\'t be too worried about this at my age (15), but I\\'ve never had a girlfriend. There have been several girls that I\\'ve liked, but nothing ever happened. Recently I started liking this girl and I thought that this was finally it. I\\'ve always thought she was pretty. She\\'s smart, she\\'s funny, and she\\'s nice. A couple times our eyes have met and she\\'d smile and we\\'ve talked a couple of times and it was always pleasant. We\\'ve texted and snapped a bit, and she seemed interested. She\\'s told me that she thinks I\\'m funny and screenshotted some of my snap stories. When she saw me in the halls she\\'d call my name and smile. I was almost certain that she liked me. But again, nothing really happened. Maybe it was my fault, maybe I should\\'ve asked her out, but my shyness and lack of confidence prevented me. There\\'s been a couple of times when I\\'ve texted/snapped her and she didn\\'t respond even though she read it. I know that she\\'s busy, but she never responded. I\\'m afraid that she\\'s moved on. I sent her a snap last night and she sent one back, but after I sent another one I guess she went to sleep or something because it wasn\\'t read until this morning. And she didn\\'t respond, even though I just asked her what was going on her with her. She barely looks at me and hasn\\'t talked to me in person for a while. I feel like shit. I think it\\'s my fault because I got too attached, but all of it makes me want to hate her. She\\'s made me promises that she didn\\'t keep, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Now I\\'m starting to question it all. All I want is someone that cares about me as much as I care about them. Someone I could talk to for hours. Someone I could hug and cuddle with, someone who will brighten my day. It feels like it\\'ll never happen. Again, I know I shouldn\\'t be too worried about this but it eats away at me. I do care. I know my shyness doesn\\'t help, but I really do try to be more social. Maybe I didn\\'t show that I cared about her enough. I don\\'t know. It\\'s gotten to the point where I see where the \"redpillers\" are coming from. I\\'m not saying that the dumb shit they believe in is right or that I believe in it and I\\'m definitely not trying to defend their beliefs, but I can see the emotions that might\\'ve caused them to become who they are. I\\'m just so fucking lonely. I think I\\'m bored with everything so when I get attached to a girl she\\'s the only one I can think about and when it doesn\\'t work out it becomes the end of the world. I still play some basketball in my driveway and I\\'ve been trying to get better at soccer and I lift weights when I can, but those only free my mind temporarily and it sucks because I still have a stomach that I can\\'t get rid of. Everything fucking sucks. I know my parents and my family love me a lot, but it honestly doesn\\'t mean much to me, which makes me feel even more like shit.  \\n  \\nSo basically this girl I really liked seems to have gotten over me, which has triggered all of these other emotions and ultimately made my life boring. I don\\'t look forward to anything in life anymore. There are some good days but life mainly feels like hell. I hate it all. I know my thoughts are probably disorganized but that\\'s how I feel and I appreciate it if you read all of this. I feel a bit better having typed all of this out. If anyone has any advice or anything then I\\'d really appreciate that too.\\n',\n",
