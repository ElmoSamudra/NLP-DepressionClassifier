# NLP-DepressionClassifier

## About
Depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of diseases that affects people of all ages and gender. It is a serious issue as depression is a leading cause of suicide. In this project, we utilized social media posts to train deep learning classifiers to detecting usersâ€™ mental states, which is normal, depressed, or suicidal. The result shows that Bidirectional-LSTM(BiLSTM) with GloVe embedding layer has the highest performance with accuracy and AUC of 79.3\% and 0.83 respectively, and it is an improvement over the baseline Support Vector Machines(SVM) model with TF-IDF word vectorizer.
