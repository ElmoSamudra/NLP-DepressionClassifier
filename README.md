# NLP-DepressionClassifier

## About
Our goal in this project is to build a deep learning classifier that detects depression and suicidal text. We implemented static convolutional neural network, bidirectional lstm and lstm with attention layer. We also used SVM as a baseline as it is a commong machine learning approach to text classification.

## Dataset
We scraped a total of 1.9 million rows from the following subreddits. We assumed that users posting on r/depression are depressed whille users posting on r/SuicideWatch are suicidal.

Subreddits:
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/](r/happy)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation](r/CasualConversation)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/](r/depression)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/](r/SuicideWatch)
