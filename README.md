# NLP-DepressionClassifier

## About
Depression is a major contributor to the overall global burden of diseases that affects people of all ages and gender. It is a serious issue as depression is a leading cause of suicide. In this paper, we utilized social media posts to train deep learning classifiers to detecting users’ mental states, which is normal, depressed, or suicidal. The result shows that Bidirectional-LSTM(BiLSTM) with GloVe embedding layer has the highest performance with accuracy and AUC of 79.3\% and 0.83 respectively, and it is an improvement over the baseline Support Vector Machines(SVM) model with TF-IDF word vectorizer.
