# NLP-DepressionClassifier

## About
Our goal in this project is to build a deep learning classifier that detects depression and suicidal text. We implemented static convolutional neural network, bidirectional lstm and lstm with attention layer. We also used SVM as a baseline as it is a commong machine learning approach to text classification.
