# NLP-DepressionClassifier

## About
Our goal in this project is to build a deep learning classifier that detects depression and suicidal text. We implemented static convolutional neural network, bidirectional lstm and lstm with attention layer. We also used SVM as a baseline as it is a common machine learning approach to text classification.

## Dataset
We scraped a total of 1.9 million rows from the following subreddits. We assumed that users posting on r/depression are depressed whille users posting on r/SuicideWatch are suicidal.

Subreddits:
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/](r/happy)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation](r/CasualConversation)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/](r/depression)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/](r/SuicideWatch)

To get the dataset, please run the scrape subreddit script in the scrape subreddit directory. Follow the example on how the scrape object can be used.

Clean the data can be done in our preprocessing subreddit script.
